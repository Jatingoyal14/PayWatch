# PayWatch - Payment Gateway Support & Monitoring Dashboard

A comprehensive, beginner-friendly dashboard for payment gateway support and monitoring. The project simulates the essential operations and responsibilities typically handled in product support engineering, including real-time transaction review, system health checking, customer ticket tracking, analytic reporting, API interaction, and troubleshooting. Built to act as an internal dashboard for technical support, product, and engineering teams in fintech or e-commerce contexts.

## üéØ Features

- **Dashboard Overview:** Displays system health stats like uptime, error rates, and API status; provides intuitive navigation.
- **Live Transaction Monitor:** Real-time feed of payment transactions with filters (status, method, date range) and search by transaction ID.
- **System Health Dashboard:** API status monitors for different services, uptime metrics, latency tracking, error rate visualization, and alerts for service degradation.
- **Interactive Troubleshooting Tool:** Diagnostic wizard for common payment issues, searchable error code database, and solution guides for rapid resolution.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Visualizations for transaction volume, success/failure rates, method distribution, and geographic mapping; options to export reports.
- **Support Ticket Simulator:** Simulated customer queries and support tickets with prioritization and status tracking; response templates for efficient handling.
- **API Testing Console:** Interface to send test requests to payment-related APIs and view responses; helps experiment with request formats, error handling, and endpoint behaviors.
- **Knowledge Base:** Document library with troubleshooting guides, API documentation snippets, FAQs, and best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend:** Single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
- **Styling:** Organized with a custom CSS design system using CSS variables. Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Visualization:** Chart.js for charts (bar, line, pie, radar) to visualize analytics data.
- **Icons:** Font Awesome for dashboard and status icons.
- **Mock Data:** In-browser JavaScript objects simulate payment flows, system status, tickets, error codes, and API endpoints. No backend required (MVP).
- **State Handling:** Local JS state, easily migratable to React/Vue or external API integration if desired.

## üé® Design Principles

- **Color Palette:** Teal/blue for primary actions, green for success, orange for warning, red for errors, gray for neutrals.
- **Typography:** System fonts for headings and body; monospace for code/documentation.
- **Layout:** Sidebar navigation, responsive grid/flex layouts for modern dashboard look.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, proper contrast, keyboard navigation.
- **User Experience:** Intuitive workflows, interactive elements, tooltips/help text, loading animations.

***

## üöÄ Customization

- Add new transaction scenarios, error codes, or API endpoint types.
- Enhance charts with additional metrics or time periods.
- Integrate with a backend server for persistent storage or real API data.
- Migrate logic to React, Vue, Angular, or similar if you need component scalability.
- Add authentication/permissions for multi-user scenarios.
